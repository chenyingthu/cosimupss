! Transformer definitions

! Since no transformer rating data exist in the Common Data Forma
! all transformer are defined as begin 100 MVA, the system base
! Thus, the conversion of impedances is simple: just multiply by 100 to get percent

! The tap in the original data is assumed to apply to the first winding.

! Transformers are modeled with their actual turns ratios

! The OpenDSS defaults to Yg-Yg connection. Since we don't have to worry about
! floating Delta windings, the PPM_antifloat property is set to 0. 

! All transformer branches are defined with R=0. This is accomplished by
! setting %Loadloss=0

! Although OpenDSS can handle 3-winding transformers the model here
! follows the model in the old data set by defining 3 separate transformers to an
! intermediate bus with a 1 kV voltage rating.  Since there is nothing connected
! there, you could actually use any voltage you wish.
